Some handy code Dan has written

jQuery Plugin Interface (JS)
----------------------------

A UMD-compatible module that maps a simple functional object to a jQuery plugin. Aims to handle all the scoping
and reference challenges with jQuery plugins so that anyone can throw one together.


QuickAPI (PHP)
--------------

An extremely modular, abstract, and incomplete API framework written in PHP. Aims to take in 100% of its contextual
dependence via a JSON configuration (data types, actions, etc.) and uses a Entity-Worker pattern.


Framework-Free JS Api (JS)
----------------------------

A UMD-compatible module that generically defines a set of API methods, returns objects as entities, and defines its own
deferreds and promises


PHP Dependency Loading (PHP)
----------------------------

PSR-0 compatible dependency injection in PHP


Source Extraction Suite (IDL)
-----------------------------

Comprehensive PSF-generation, source-finding and PSF-fitting code. In a very rough state at the moment,
maybe I'll re-organize it some weekend.
