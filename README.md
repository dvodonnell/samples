Some handy code Dan has written

jQuery Plugin Interface (JS)
----------------------------

A UMD-compatible module that maps a simple functional object to a jQuery plugin. Aims to handle all the scoping
and reference challenges with jQuery plugins so that anyone can throw one together.


QuickAPI (PHP)
--------------

An extremely modular, abstract, and incomplete API framework written in PHP. Aims to take in 100% of its contextual
dependence via a JSON configuration (data types, actions, etc.) and uses a Entity-Worker pattern.

Note that this has sort of evolved in to this work in progress: [BrassTacks PHP](https://github.com/dvocreative/brasstacks-php)


Framework-Free JS Api (JS)
----------------------------

A UMD-compatible module that generically defines a set of API methods, returns objects as entities, and defines its own
deferreds and promises


PHP Dependency Loading (PHP)
----------------------------

PSR-0 compatible dependency injection in PHP


Source Extraction Suite (IDL)
-----------------------------

WARNING, this code is in a very rough state, was written many many years ago before I developed many of my coding chops.
However, it's still here because from a theory point of view, I'm still very proud of what it does :). Maybe I'll
clean it up and give it back to the astrophysics community some day.
